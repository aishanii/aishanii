### Hello! :sunflower:
### I'm a Computer Science undergrad student. I'm a data science enthusiast, and my willingness to learn is _limitless_. I'm fascinated by technologies that can bring positive changes. I'm also into writing blog posts- both technical and non-technical, reading, literature, dance, and exploring all things bright and beautiful.
